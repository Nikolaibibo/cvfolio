My role involved driving digital innovation across high-profile campaigns, managing a talented team of developers, and implementing cutting-edge web technologies to create exceptional interactive experiences. I established technical standards, optimized development workflows, and ensured seamless collaboration between design, UX, and backend teams to deliver award-winning solutions.

Key responsibilities included:
- Architecting and implementing cutting-edge frontend solutions for flagship digital campaigns across BMW, Telefonica, and other major brands
- Directing a team of 15+ frontend developers, establishing technical standards, and mentoring junior talent
- Leading client-facing innovation workshops to showcase emerging technologies and their potential business applications
- Developing interactive prototypes that leveraged HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and emerging web APIs to push creative boundaries
- Collaborating with UX designers, creative directors, and backend teams to deliver seamless cross-platform digital experiences
- Evaluating and integrating new technologies including early AR/VR platforms, responsive frameworks, and interactive visualization tools

As part of a strategic partnership, I was embedded within Fork Unstable Media where I collaborated directly with the executive board on technology innovation initiatives. In this dual role, I spearheaded the development of pioneering prototypes, contributed valuable technical expertise to new business pitches, and helped establish a culture of digital experimentation that significantly strengthened both agencies' competitive positioning in the market.
